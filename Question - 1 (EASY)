1. initState(): 

/This method is called when the StatefulWidget is inserted into the widget tree for the first time. 
/It is used for initialization tasks that need to be performed only once. 

Example Code: In this code, _message is initialized to 'Hello, World!' inside the initState() method. 
              This value will persist throughout the lifetime of the widget and won't change unless the widget is rebuilt.
"

class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  
String _message = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _message = 'Hello, World!';
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(_message);
  }
}

2. setState():
This method is used to update the state of a StatefulWidget. 
When you call setState(), Flutter rebuilds the widget, updating any properties that have changed. 

Example Code: In this example, _message is initially an empty string. 
              When the button is pressed, _updateMessage() is called, which updates _message to 'Hello, Flutter!' by calling setState(). 
              As a result, the widget is rebuilt, and the updated message is displayed.
"
"
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  String _message = '';

  void _updateMessage() {
    setState(() {
      _message = 'Hello, Flutter!';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text(_message),
        RaisedButton(
          onPressed: _updateMessage,
          child: Text('Update Message'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

//In summary, initState() is used for one-time initialization tasks, typically performed when the widget is first inserted into the tree. 
//On the other hand, setState() is used to update the state of the widget and trigger a rebuild of the widget tree with the updated state.
